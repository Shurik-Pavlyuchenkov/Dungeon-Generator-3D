# Dungeon-Generator-3D
An algorithm for building multi-storey dungeons in three-dimensional space. It is similar to the grammar-based dungeon construction method, but with a number of changes.

The input is the number of rooms that need to be generated and the maximum size of these rooms, as well as the size of the field on which all this will be generated. The output of the algorithm is a representative model that can already be used to build a dungeon by applying textures to it.
